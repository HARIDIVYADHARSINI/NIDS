# NIDS
It monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and alerts administrators to potential threats. It detects attacks using either signature-based or anomaly-based detection methods to keep networks secure.

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an essential cybersecurity tool designed to monitor network traffic for malicious activities, security threats, or policy violations. It provides a passive security layer that helps organizations detect potential cyberattacks before they cause damage.

Core Functionality
NIDS operates by analyzing data packets traveling across a network. It does this by:
- Capturing Network Traffic: It monitors packets in real time using a promiscuous mode, meaning it can see all network activity without actively interacting with it.
- Analyzing Patterns: It examines traffic for known attack signatures or unusual patterns that might indicate suspicious behavior.
- Generating Alerts: If a threat is detected, NIDS alerts security administrators so they can take action, such as blocking suspicious IPs or enhancing firewall rules.

Working Stages of NIDS
A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) operates in several key stages to effectively monitor network traffic and identify threats:
- Traffic Capture: NIDS passively listens to network packets flowing through communication channels.
- Preprocessing: It filters irrelevant data and organizes packets for analysis.
- Pattern Analysis: Using signature-based and anomaly-based techniques, NIDS compares packet behavior to known attack signatures or normal network activity.
- Threat Identification: If unusual or malicious activity is detected, NIDS generates alerts.
- Response & Reporting: Security teams receive notifications to investigate and mitigate threats.

Advantages of NIDS
- Wide Network Coverage: Monitors the entire network instead of individual hosts- .
- Real-Time Threat Detection: Identifies security incidents as they happen.
- Supports Incident Response: Helps cybersecurity teams react quickly to intrusions.
- Low System Impact: Since NIDS is passive, it doesnâ€™t slow down network operations.
- Flexible Deployment: Can be integrated with other security tools like firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).
